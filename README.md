# Operating-Systems-Final

Draw It or Lose It is a game application where teams compete to guess at a puzzle by drawing images representing clues.  This application is owned by Creative Technology Solutions.  There are 4 rounds lasting one minute each.  The initial team has 30 seconds to guess if they do not guess right within the time limit the other teams have 15 seconds to guess right.  Creative Techology Solutions wants to expand the game to be web based to offer availablity to more platforms and players.

In the design document I have provided detailed analysis concerning the environment I believe Creative Technology Solutions should utilize in order to take the infrastructure concerns away and allow them to focus on the application functionality.  The design document outlines the constraints, functionality, and possible limitations of building this application for the web.  
If I could change one thing about my design template it would be the Evaluation.  I would add more of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the operating platforms and there individuals differences.  

I interpreted the users needs by probing exactly what experience the company wanted the players to have.  The users needs are the most important considering it is the user that will be interacting with the application.  If the company wants more users to join or to spend more time on the app it needs to be entertaining, easily understood, and navigated.  Outlining the user's story was effective for designing software.  It acts as a window into the experience you want to create when people use the application in the future I would use the same tactic to create different apps similiar to Draw It or Lose It.
